ðŸ“Œ Part 1 â€“ Alert Enrichment Documentation
Introduction
In this task, I automated an SOC workflow by enriching alerts (IP addresses) with additional context such as country, region, city, and ISP details using a free IP geolocation API (ip-api.com).

Tools Used

Python 3.x

requests library

CSV files for input/output

Steps Followed

Created a folder D:\Nullclass_Task1.

Created an input file alerts.csv with sample IPs and usernames.

Wrote alert_enrichment.py script to:

Read IPs from alerts.csv,

Query ip-api.com for geolocation,

Write results to enriched_alerts.csv.

Ran the script and verified output.

Code Used
(See alert_enrichment.py in this folder)

Output
Example from enriched_alerts.csv:

Copy code

Challenges & Solutions

File not found errors â†’ solved by checking correct folder and enabling file extensions.

Wrong file extension (.txt) â†’ solved by renaming properly to .py and .csv.

Outcome
Successfully enriched alerts with geolocation data and generated a new CSV output
